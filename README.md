# Scripts I create because i'm lazy ðŸ˜Ž

## Reasons to not use any of my scripts
1. As the keen observer can deduce from the title, im lazy.
so the scripts are not well designed, and only tested once on my system(s), they might mess yours up 
2. i can't be bothered to write all of them.

### TODO: ðŸš€

- [ ] Git diff script
- [X] Git delete local branches that are `done`: somewhat done, but needs a lot of work.
- [ ] Yarn update
- [ ] google calender: return list of the day/week
- [ ] turn slack noti on/off
- [ ] check prod servers health
- [ ] js mdn doc search. eg mds `array.find` return link and top example.
    * same for other docs
- [ ] gist -> vsCode snippets (probeable exists but i cant be bothered to look)
- [ ] connect the scripts to the cli: https://github.com/dennisolien/cli
- [ ] create project
    * options: express, ts/js, gql, eslint ++
    * use template repos, and gists.
- [ ] ls, remote repos. eg. gitls: returns a list of urls to all repos i have access to, filter on org,personal,public ++
- [ ] script to update index.js files. if all files in a dir have same struct, like model files, loop over and update the exports.
